 * Amber — entry script

 * Per-widget modules register themselves with jax.registerControl() on import.
 * Heavy widgets should use dynamic import() inside the bundle rather than
 * being included here, so they only load when first encountered.
 *
 * Requires the larajax framework bundle to be loaded first so window.jax
 * is available.
